doubledollar.js
===============

A small javascript library to wrap some DOMy stuff into a more convenient fashion and promisify a few other things.

Works best with Vanilla JS and/or web components.

About the Versions
------------------

There are two versions of the library, one based on [XmlHttpRequest](https://caniuse.com/#feat=xhr2) and one on [fetch](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch). There are differences around the AJAX APIs due to the thinness of this wrapping.
