doubledollar.js
===============

A small javascript library to wrap some DOMy stuff into a more convenient fashion and promisify a few other things.

Works best with Vanilla JS and/or web components.

About the Versions
------------------

There are two versions of the library, one based on XmlHttpRequest and one on fetch. There are some subtle differences between them, although I try to keep the APIs the same.
